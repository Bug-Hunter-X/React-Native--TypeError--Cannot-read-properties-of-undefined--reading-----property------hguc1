This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It's particularly common in React Native when dealing with asynchronous operations or data fetching where the data might not be available immediately.  For example, you might be trying to render a component that relies on data fetched from an API, but the API call hasn't completed yet, resulting in a null or undefined value.
